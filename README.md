## OneCycle MIPS

The OneCycle MIPS in OneCycle.srcs supports the instructions including:

addï¼Œsubï¼Œandï¼Œorï¼Œsltï¼Œaddiï¼Œandiï¼Œoriï¼Œsltiï¼Œswï¼Œlwï¼Œjï¼Œnopï¼Œbeqï¼Œbne,  jal,  jr,  sra,  sll,  srl, which sum up to 20.

So you can implore many operations like shift, stack, call and ret.

**Hints:**

If you want to simulate the top.v, then you'll find that all the results are "XX", because the clock divider I set is very large, i.e. q[26], q[23], so you won't see any change because the clock offered to CPU doesn't reach the positive edge. An easy way to fix this problem is to change the clock divider to smaller one, like q[0], and when you run the codes on the board, you should change it back.



## MultiCycle MIPS

The MultiCycle MIPS still need to be improved, since it only pass the ad hoc testing in **Harris's Digital Design Computer Architecture**' s 7.4

### 2019.4.19

successfully pass most tests on <https://github.com/Oxer11/MIPS/tree/master/Assembler/example>, including **quick_multiply.out** which needs srl, sll and **factorial.out** covering jal, jr. Next time, I'll try the Pipeline and I want to add the FPU instruction set.



## Pipeline

### 2019.5.10

Today, I have just pass the ad hoc testing in **Harris's Digital Design Computer Architecture**' s 7.4, and it's the most difficult time to complete the basic version. Pipeline has so many signals to  look into which have confused me greatly. Worse still, the mechanism behind is also different from OneCycle and MultiCycle since you have 5 instructions run at the same time and you have to deal with many hazards. Forwarding data branch predictionðŸ˜µ, WTF!!! It's just drive me crazyðŸ¤¬

### 2019.5.16

Today, I've finished the Dynamic Prediction using Branch Prediction Buffer(only one prediction bit). And I've passed most tests on <https://github.com/Oxer11/MIPS/tree/master/Assembler/example>, and branch prediction indeed declines the nop inserted in the Pipeline. And there is a tiny bug in my Branch Prediction Buffer's update, but it won't bring out any problems in the tests I've passed, maybe I'll fix it next Monday. 

And to be honest, it's a bit challenging for me since from OneCycle to Pipeline most of what I do is just copying the code from my teacher's PPT and adding some trivial things but this time I only referred to **Computer organization and architecture by Chun feng Yuan** and finish the code all by myself. And I think it's interesting and meaningful to do this, because it surely helps me understand the Pipeline clearlier. And I think I may eat my words that I'll add the FPU since the final is approaching, so it's difficult for me to deal with it.

### 2019.5.26

Today, I'm messed with my ubuntu os, and begin my journal on it.
